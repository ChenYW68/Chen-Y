abstract: Accurate estimation of treatment effects and reliable ranking of treatment regimens are essential to guide optimal treatment assignments in cluster randomized trials (CRTs). However, these efforts are often hindered by high bias and large variance. The high bias can arise from indirect effects (IEs) or time-varying direct effects (DEs), while the large variance results primarily from inadequate consideration of intrinsic dependencies. Motivated by the need to identify optimal treatment regimens in the Schistosomiasis CRT, this study addresses the methodological challenges introduced by sequential treatments and spatiotemporal dependencies. We identify optimal treatment regimens by evaluating differences through two components: DEs from the most recent treatment and IEs from historical treatment trajectories. To efficiently estimate DEs and IEs, we develop a Joint Spatiotemporal Varying Coefficient (JSTVC) model. JSTVC accounts for spatiotemporal dependencies and regional heterogeneities, while also capturing spatial anisotropic patterns in schistosomiasis transmission.
